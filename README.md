# Basic Sampling Algorithms in Python

This repository contains the code for basic sampling algorithms written in Python

The algorithms (currently) include:
- inverse transform sampling
- importance sampling

## How to run the code
1) Install the Python modules in ```requirements.txt```
2) Run the Jupyter Notebooks
